# MealDB API Project

This project fetches and displays data from the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) for users to explore meal categories and ingredients. Users can fetch meal categories (e.g., seafood) or meals based on specific ingredients (e.g., chicken breast).

## Features
- **Get Category Data**: Fetches meals from a specific category (e.g., Seafood) and logs the data to the console.
- **Get Ingredient Data**: Fetches meals where the main ingredient is a specified ingredient (e.g., chicken breast) and logs the data to the console.
- The project uses the `fetch()` API to get data from MealDB and provides minimal styling for a simple user interface.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Minimal styling)
- JavaScript (to fetch data from the MealDB API)
